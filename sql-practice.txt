People get picky at the end of the night. Add another SELECT that uses AND to show the titles of songs that are 'epic', and released after 1990, and less than 4 minutes long.
Note that the duration column is measured in seconds.

CREATE TABLE songs (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT,
    artist TEXT,
    mood TEXT,
    duration INTEGER,
    released INTEGER);
    
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("Bohemian Rhapsody", "Queen", "epic", 60, 1975);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("Let it go", "Idina Menzel", "epic", 227, 2013);

    SELECT title FROM songs;
    SELECT title FROM songs WHERE mood = "epic" OR released > 1990;
    SELECT title FROM songs WHERE mood = "epic" AND released > 1990 AND duration < "240";

We've created a database of songs and artists, and you'll make playlists from them in this challenge. In this first step, select the title of all the songs by the artist named 'Queen'.

Now you'll make a 'Pop' playlist. In preparation, select the name of all of the artists from the 'Pop' genre.
(Tip: Make sure you type it 'Pop', SQL considers that different from 'pop'.)

To finish creating the 'Pop' playlist, add another query that will select the title of all the songs from the 'Pop' artists. It should use IN on a nested subquery that's based on your previous query.

We've created a database of a few popular authors and their books, with word counts for each book. In this first step, select all the authors who have written more than 1 million words, using GROUP BY and HAVING. Your results table should include the 'author' and their total word count as a 'total_words' column.

Now select all the authors that write more than an average of 150,000 words per book. Your results table should include the 'author' and average words as an 'avg_words' column.
